            <!-- Challenge Selection -->
            <h2 id="challenge">Challenge Selected for Group 1 (4.23)</h2>

            <h3>Challenge:</h3>
            <p>Consider a two-player game played with pegs of six different colors. One player (the encrypter) selects four pegs of different colors and places them in a certain order. The other player (the decrypter) guesses the order to uncover the hidden code, guided by feedback using black and white pegs. The challenge involves writing a JavaScript program that simulates this encryption-decryption game, enhancing logical thinking and problem-solving skills.</p>
            
            <h3>Justification:</h3>
            <p>This challenge was an excellent choice for Group 1 as it required the integration of complex logic and strategic thinking, skills essential for computer science students. By designing and implementing a game that simulates cryptographic principles, participants improved their programming prowess and problem-solving capabilities. This experience not only deepened their understanding of JavaScript but also fostered a practical application of encryption and decryption methodologies, which are pivotal in real-world computer science scenarios.</p>
            
            <h3>Group 10 Assigned Problem (3.25) Understanding:</h3>
            <p>The CSS 'fixed' positioning is a powerful feature that anchors an element to a specific position relative to the viewport, regardless of scrolling. This property is particularly useful for creating persistently visible elements like navigation bars or floating action buttons. Testing across browsers reveals its broad support, although issues may arise in older versions like IE6, highlighting the importance of cross-browser compatibility testing.</p>
            <img src="3.25-diagram.jpeg" alt="Diagram of CSS fixed positioning">
            
            <h3>Group 1 Assigned Problem (4.23) Understanding:</h3>
            <p>This simulation of an encryption-decryption game using pegs of different colors not only tests but significantly enhances the player's problem-solving and logical thinking skills. By engaging in this game, players learn to strategize based on the feedback given, which mimics real-world scenarios where decisions are made based on partial information. This exercise was particularly beneficial in sharpening the participants' abilities to analyze and deduce under constraints.</p>
            
            <h2>How we completed the Challenge</h2>
            <img src="group-10-challenge.jpeg" alt="CSS fixed positioning">
            <p>To address the challenge, we applied 'fixed' positioning to the navbar of our website, demonstrating a practical use of CSS positioning. This technique allowed us to illustrate the contrasting behaviors between 'static' and 'fixed' positioning. With 'fixed' positioning, the navbar remains consistently visible at the top of the viewport as users scroll through the page, enhancing usability and accessibility. In contrast, 'static' positioning would leave the navbar at its original location in the document flow, disappearing from view as the user scrolls down. This experiment not only met the challenge requirements but also showcased how strategic CSS styling can influence user experience and interface dynamics.</p>
